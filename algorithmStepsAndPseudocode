Searching Algorithm

Problem = searching for specific value in large data

Solution =
Step1: Start
Step2: Input text, pattern
Step3: Search through text
Step4: Search through pattern
Step5: Is character in pattern == character in text?
        if so increament match_cout
Step6: Is match_cout == length of pattern?
        if so print pattern found!
Step7: End


Pseudocode

define text, pattern
if entire text not searched
  create match_count =0
  if entire pattern not searched
    if pattern character == pattern text
      increament match_cout
  if match_count == pattern length
    print pattern found!
else 
  pattern not found!
